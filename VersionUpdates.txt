>>> smod.DoStochSim() then generates 1 trajectory with 1000 time steps
>>> smod.Trajectories(1000)
>>> smod.DoStochSim(end=100, mode='time') then generates 1000 trajectories until t = 100

- Modified the default Export2File functionality

Updates 1.1.0
-------------

   2. data_stochsim.propensities_standard_deviations
   3. data_stochsim.propensities_moments
- User can print propensity means and standard deviations with: PrintPropensitiesMeans() and PrintPropensitiesStandardDeviations()

- User can analyse averaged distributions of species and propensities: smodGetAverageSpeciesDistributions(),smod.GetAveragePropensitiesDistributions(),smod.PlotAverageSpeciesDistributions(),smod.PlotAveragePropensitiesDistributions
- Write2File() is not longer supported. Users must exploit Export2File which has the same functionalities
- Arguments of Export2File are completely altered. For more information see the latest user guide
- Improved handling of (SBML) events 
- Error messages are more effective
- More arguments for plotting functions
- Solved bug in headers of export2file

  2. PlotInterpolatedData() --> PlotAverageSpeciesTimeCourses()
  3. PrintInterpolatedData() --> PrintAverageSpeciesTimeCourse()
  4. PrintTimeSim() --> PrintSpeciesTimeCourses()
  5. PlotTimesim() --> PlotSpeciesTimeCourses()
  6. ShowMeans() --> PrintSpeciesMeans()
  7. ShowStandardDeviations() --> PrintSpeciesStandardDeviations()

  9. PlotWaitingtimes() --> PlotWaitingtimesDistributions()
  10. PrintWaitingtimes() --> PrintWaitingtimesDistributions()
  11. GetMeanWaitingtimes() --> GetWaitingtimesMeans()
  12. PrintMeanWaitingtimes() --> PrintWaitingtimesMeans()
  13. data_stochsim.waitingtimes_mean --> data_stochsim.waiting_times_means
  Note that the old functions names are not longer supported. 
- xlabel, ylabel, and IsLegend are additional arguments in all plotting functions

- data_stochsim_interpolated --> data_stochsim_grid
- The warning message - "Warning: do not use net stoichiometries for framed-based simulators. Use X > {2}  in stead of $pool > X" - is always shown if users of StochPy exploit Cain and/or StochKit solvers

Updates 1.0.5:
--------------
- StochPy.SaveInteractiveSession(filename,path) if you want to store the interactive modelling session
- additional argument 'maxpoints2plot' for PlotTimeSimulation and PlotPropensities to allow faster plotting of large simulations. This argument is by default set to 10000 points which is normally enough to get nice and fast plots.
- StochPyCellDivions as an example of performing sequential simulations
- StochPyCain: you can use the Cain solvers in StochPy if you want faster (but less accurate) solvers. You need to download and install a separate package, StochPyCain.
- StochPyKit you can use the StochKit solvers in StochPy if you want faster (but less accurate) solvers. You need to download and install a separate package, StochPyKit.
- You cannot use the Plotting, Printing, or Exporting functions before doing a simulation. In previous versions, a simulation was started if no simulation was done such that plotting was possible, but this version gives an error message.
